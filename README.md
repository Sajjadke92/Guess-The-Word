Guess The Word Game
The idea behind the project was to create a simple and engaging word-guessing game. The game randomly selects a word from various predefined file with different categories and challenges the player to guess the word one letter at a time or by guessing the whole word. The player has a limited number of wrong guesses before they lose the game. The game is designed to be fun and educational.
Here I explain the game steps:
1.	Player Name Input: The game starts by asking the player to enter their name. 
2.	Category Selection: The game randomly selects a category from a predefined list of categories.
3.	Word Selection: A word is chosen randomly from the selected category.
4.	Game Rules Display: The player is informed about the rules and given hints about the word.
5.	Word Guessing: The player guesses letters or the whole word. The game provides feedback and updates the hidden word accordingly. (The hidden word is the original word with an underscore instead of each letter)
6.	Game End: The game continues until the player guesses the word or exceeds the maximum number of wrong guesses. The game then announces the result.
7.	Play Again Option: The player is asked if they want to play again. The game restarts or rematches based on their response.
